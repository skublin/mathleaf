## Introduction
In this post (my first ever) I would like to share my current pipeline used to write, publish, and build content on the website your currently on. It is based on awesome idea of [Network Chuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnE7c0ELEH8), but with more custom automations. 

The goal here is to use Obsidian as text editor, and after your post is ready, just push it to GitHub, and let the magic happen. To do so, all you need is Obsidian (duh!), GitHub account, VPS able to run nginx and docker to host your website, as well as domain for that website. However, to make it a bit fancier and modern I will add some AI features in near feature, just stay tuned.

Overview of our pipeline is pretty simple and straightforward.
